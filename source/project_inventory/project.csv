ecker_sn_ATACseq,Chromatin accessibility profiling of genomic DNA in individual mouse brain cell nuclei (RS1.2),"Overall statement: \n The goal is to profile open chromatin at single cell resolution using snATAC-seq across >100 mouse brain regions. The resulting profiles will be used to both define cell types and generate comprehensive catalogs of regulatory elements for each cell type. \n Statement about this dataset: \n The brains of adult male C57BL/6J mice (P56) were sliced into 18 ? 600 micron thick coronal sections and tissues isolated from selected regions in each slice were pooled separately (6-30 animals per region, hemispheres combined). Pooled nuclei were subjected to tagged Tn5 transposon insertion to identify accessible chromatin (snATAC-seq). (Note: The same tissue pools were used in both RS1.1 and RS1.2.) \n Scope of this dataset: \n Over 100 selected brain regions were sampled across both brain hemispheres in male mice.",1386599,nucleus
ecker_sn_mCseq,DNA methylation profiling of genomic DNA in individual mouse brain cell nuclei (RS1.1),"Overall statement: \n The goal is to generate single nucleus methyl-C genomic DNA sequencing data from isolated cells from >100 regions of the mouse brain for both cell-type classification and the identification of regulatory elements. \n Statement about this dataset: \n The brains of adult male C57BL/6J mice (P56) were sliced into 18 ? 600 micron thick coronal sections and tissues isolated from selected regions in each slice were pooled separately (6-30 animals per region, hemispheres combined). NeuN-positive and NeuN-negative cell nuclei were purified from each pool, and isolated nuclei subjected to single nuclei methyl-C DNA sequencing (snmC-seq2).

ecker_sn_mCseq_retro,Regional DNA methylation profiling of individual projection neurons isolated from the mouse brain (RS2.1),"Overall statement: \n The goal is to generate single nucleus methyl-C DNA sequence data from purified projection neurons from >100 neuronal circuits in the mouse brain. \n Statement about this dataset: \n Recombinant AAV is injected bilaterally into selected brain regions in INTACT mice (B6.129-Gt(ROSA)26Sortm5(CAG-Sun1/sfGFP)Nat/MmbeJ animals in the C57BL/6 background, Jax stock #030952 @ two male and two female animals per injection site). Two weeks post AAV infection (P56), dissection of mouse brains follows the slice/region isolation protocol used in RS1. GFP-positive nuclei of projection neurons are isolated from the tissue segments pooled from selected anatomical regions that are known to project to the initial injection target, and subjected to single nuclei methyl-C DNA sequence analysis (snmC-seq2). \n Scope of this dataset: \n Over 100 brain region pairings are analyzed from both male and female mice.",32404,nucleus

Coarse dissections of individual or multiple adjacent brain regions were performed from both hemispheres in both male and female mice. Fluorescence activated sorting of cells was performed based on expression of fluorescent reporter labels to obtain pools of labeled cells. These pools of cells were processed for single cell RNA sequencing using 10x Chromium v2, which isolated individual cells in droplets to assign individual cell barcodes. This method enables a rapid, large-scale survey of cell types throughout the brain at moderate gene coverage per cell. \n Scope of this dataset: \n This dataset will survey all major regions of the mouse brain.",1722731,cell

zeng_sc_SSv4,U19 Zeng transcriptomics - Transcriptomic cell types in the mouse brain: SMART-seq cells,"Overall statement: \n Our goal is to create a high-quality atlas of cell types in the mouse brain using large scale single cell transcriptomic analysis across the entire mouse brain. \n Statement about this dataset: \n Transgenic or viral strategies were used to label specific cell populations in the brain with fluorescent reporters. Sample collection was biased to enable sampling of as many cell types as possible and reduce redundant cell type collection. Most of the cells in this dataset were collected using broad Cre-driver lines that labeled all neurons (Snap25-IRES2-Cre), all Glutamatergic cells (Slc17a7-IRES2-Cre), or all GABAergic cells (Slc32a1-IRES-Cre or Gad2-IRES-Cre). Cells from primary visual cortex (VISp) and anterior lateral motor cortex (ALM, a subset of secondary motor cortex, MOs) were collected from a broad set of transgenic driver and reporter combinations in addition to the broad lines specified above. Fine dissections of brain regions and cortical layers were performed and tracked throughout sample processing. Specimens were dissected from both hemispheres in both male and female mice. Fluorescence activated sorting of cells was performed based on expression or absence of fluorescent reporter labels to isolate individual cells into separate tubes. Isolated cells were processed for single cell RNA sequencing using SMARTer v4. This method enables tracking of dissection location and high gene detection per cell to identify fine differences in gene expression and highly selective marker genes. \n Scope of this dataset: \n This dataset will survey all major regions of the mouse brain. \n Publication: \n Tasic, B. et al.

These pools of nuclei were processed for single nucleus RNA sequencing using 10X Chromium v2, which isolated nuclei in droplets to assign individual nucleus barcodes. This method enables a rapid, large-scale survey of cell types in brain regions with accurate recovery of cell type proportions, but at low gene coverage per nucleus. \n Scope of this dataset: \n This dataset surveys cells in the primary motor cortex (MOp) as well as regions where isolation of whole cells is difficult, or nuclear profiling is needed to establish cell type proportions.",88521,nucleus
